# Welcome to my Trybe Fundamentals Module Projects!

<img src="https://thumbs.gfycat.com/MeagerLonelyBluebreastedkookaburra-max-1mb.gif" align="right" alt="GIF" height="220px">

Here you will find all the projects that I developed in the **fundamentals module** as a student at trybe programming school! *Enjoy it!!*

But remember: focus on **functionality**, not in styles implemented on projects. üë®‚Äçüíª It is important to make clear that: *design* **is not** *development* and *development* **is not** *design*!

I hope you have fun browsing around here. And if it's not fun, at least give it some inspiration to you.

But even so, little by little I'm going back and styling the projects. So if you have any suggestions, please leave your comment! I will really appreciate this! :two_hearts:

:dancer: Thanks for read! Enjoy the visit! :dancer:

- ## [Project - Lessons Learned](https://fumagallilaura.github.io/Trybe-Projects/Lessons-Learned/) :fist_oncoming:

 *My first contact*

This project is the result of the first contacts I had with HTML and CSS! 

It's not very professional, as you can see, but I tried to apply the knowledge acquired so far in the course as much as possible.

*Suggestions?*

Leave your comment [here](https://github.com/fumagallilaura/Trybe-Projects/commit/615e0a12257e1e2acabafc968ababd3662f2005c)! Thanks :fist_oncoming:

- ## [Project - Pixel Art](https://fumagallilaura.github.io/Trybe-Projects/Pixel-Art/) :art:

*Playing with CSS and JS*

This project is the result of the first contacts I had with JavaScript!

This one is not so professional either, as you can see, but I tried to mix the previously acquired knowledge with the new ones.

*Suggestions?*

Leave your comment [here](https://github.com/fumagallilaura/Trybe-Projects/commit/ea28f074f4e1722b2b35adca47f6442996e33ce6)! Thanks :art:

- ## [Project - To Do List](https://fumagallilaura.github.io/Trybe-Projects/To-Do-List/) :scroll:

*More JS*

This project is to be more functional than anything else.

You can add tasks to it, cross off the completed ones, paint the important ones, and delete the tasks you no longer want to appear. Excellent for training JavaScript!

*Suggestions?*

Leave your comment [here](https://github.com/fumagallilaura/Trybe-Projects/commit/ae50d10c0140e4b69a0a2074324da090344426c1)! Thanks :scroll:

- ## [Project - Meme Generator](https://fumagallilaura.github.io/Trybe-Projects/Meme-Generator/) :trollface:

*A fun one!*

This project is a meme generator! (suggestive name, I guess)

You can select pre-existing memes or upload images from your computer to create new ones! Pretty cool, don't you think?

*Suggestions?*

Leave your comment [here](https://github.com/fumagallilaura/Trybe-Projects/commit/b37d9213ab2642a19f42d6adce18ea6f149df792)! Thanks :trollface:

- ## [Project - Color Guess](https://fumagallilaura.github.io/Trybe-Projects/Color-Guess/) :dart:

*Test your skills*

In this project, at each reload a new colors appear and the user needs to guess which color's RGB

More JavaScript training, thus fixing the learned knowledge very well

*Suggestions?*

Leave your comment [here](https://github.com/fumagallilaura/Trybe-Projects/commit/1c312a28210b15bb033f62ed62ca592ec98d53e5)! Thanks :dart:

- ## [Project - Mystery Letter](https://fumagallilaura.github.io/Trybe-Projects/Mistery-Letter/) :love_letter:

**Letter very crazy!**

In this project, at each reload a new colors appear and the user needs to guess which color's RGB

This project helped me train how to merge JavaScript with CSS!

**Suggestions?**

Leave your comment [here](https://github.com/fumagallilaura/Trybe-Projects/commit/85de4c53bcad2ca993f40f98747c7dd495609d41)! Thanks :love_letter:

- ## [Project - Trybewarts](https://fumagallilaura.github.io/Trybe-Projects/Trybewarts/) :fist_right: :fist_left:

**Hogwa... rather, TRYBEWARTS!**

As a Harry Potter lover, I can say that I LOVED working on this project!

Training the ability to manipulate forms and also how to work in a group (softskills)! It was a pair work, using Github, giving a lot of conflicts and solving them all!

**Suggestions?**

Leave your comment [here](https://github.com/fumagallilaura/Trybe-Projects/commit/5ee9604f2e10b1ff1ddec0c2bbe5d4ec4e18162f)! Thanks :fist_right: :fist_left:

- ## [Project - JavaScript Unit Tests](https://github.com/fumagallilaura/Trybe-Projects/tree/main/Unit-Tests) :radioactive:

**Learning unit tests**

In this project I trained for the first time to handle unit tests, export objects to there, to here...

It was quite challenging, but a necessary step in this long journey of programming

**Suggestions?**

Leave your comment [here](https://github.com/fumagallilaura/Trybe-Projects/commit/0efeb28244134be0fe9e6c3f9283098c2e893a98)! Thanks :radioactive:

- ## [Project - Zoo functions](https://github.com/fumagallilaura/Trybe-Projects/tree/main/Zoo-Functions) :elephant:

**Programming logic**

It was here that I felt the greatest incentive to start solving codewars problems!

With a lot about functions learned, for me this was the most difficult project of the module, forcing me to use every last neuron to develop the best logic possible.

**Suggestions?**

- ## [Project - Shopping Cart](https://fumagallilaura.github.io/Trybe-Projects/Shopping-Cart/) :shopping_cart:

**Final Project!!**

Here we have a mix of everything learned in the fundamentals module! From the most basic of HTML to asynchronous functions and tests

It was really amazing to think of so many features together!

**Suggestions?**
